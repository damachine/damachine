# - **👋 Hi, I'm Christian** -

Hello, I'm a guy who gives 30% effort to understand the machine, but 100% to look like a hacker. 😎💻

🐧 Linux is my OS of choice!

> I don't always use Linux, but when I do, I sudo.⚡ 

🚀 **My Mission**

- 🔧 Crafting tools that make life easier (and maybe a bit cooler)
- 🤝 Sharing knowledge & code with the open source crowd
- 🏡 Turning home work from "nice idea" into "works every day"
- 📈 Always learning, always leveling up – because the machine never sleeps!

In this spirit: **KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid!**
